### Impact of Homeownership on Credit Card Delinquency Rates
**TL;DR:** This project analyzed the impact of homeownership status on credit card delinquency rates. We used descriptive statistics, simulation, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. 

Key findings:

- Mortgage holders had the highest average delinquency rate
- Renters had the lowest average delinquency rate
- Hypothesis tests confirmed statistically significant relationships between homeownership status and delinquency
- The impact of average current balance on delinquency behavior changes with homeownership type
- An improved regression model including additional variables and interaction terms increased the R-squared value and decreased Mean Square Prediction Error

The study concluded that homeownership status significantly influences delinquency rates, recommending that banks consider this factor in lending decisions while accounting for other confounding variables.
